The networked delivery of medical journal content along with innovative 
presentation of associated abstracting and indexing data presents new issues 
for the evolving digital library. This paper examines some of the strategies 
deployed towards the development of a

are indexed by the <A HREF="http://www.cnidr.org/cnidr_projects/freewais.html">

<A HREF="ftp://nlmpubs.nlm.nih.gov/nlminfo/factsheets/mesh.txt">
Medical Subject Headings </a>are extracted from the MEDLINE records and 
separately indexed to provide an interface to the search engine. The resulting 
search scheme provides both manual entered term searching as well as authorized 
term searching. 
<A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/WWW_2_94/searchresults">
Search results </a>provide extended bibliographic data along with an 
interface to search the authorized terms for each article and a hypertext link 
directly to the scanned text images for that article. The

was modified to include code from the UNIX 
<A href="http://www.bsdi.com/bsdi-man/?file%28%29">file(1)</a> in order to 
determine the content type from the actual data in the file instead of relying 
on the file extension, which is not descriptive as provided by AT&amp;T. A 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.library.ucsf.edu/pub/util/Mosaic-tiff/">graphical WWW client capable of displaying TIFF images </a>is required to use the system.</font> 
<p>
<h2><font face="Arial Narrow">1.	Introduction</font>	</H2>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	With the rapid increase in computer processor speed, data storage capacity and network band-width, 
the academic research library is poised to emerge from its formerly limited role as centralized repository for 
print material to move toward a more ubiquitous presence as a provider of knowledge management tools 
<A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/public/Papers/KnowledgeMgt/RefiningRoles/RefiningRoles.html">[Lucier 90]</a>.  The changes that libraries face in moving from a paper collection towards a center for 
information dispersal are similar to those faced by publishers, whose entire modus operandi is challenged 
by the migration from paper-based information dissemination in favor of electronic content delivery.  
Towards working through some if these novel issues, the University of California, San Francisco, in 
collaboration with AT&amp;T and publisher Springer-Verlag, have implemented the Red Sage on-line journal 
delivery project.</font>
<p>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">1.1.	Red Sage Project</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	Based on AT&amp;T's RightPages<TM> client-server journal browsing system, the Red Sage collection 
comprises approximately 60 journal titles.  The publishers supply AT&amp;T with the paper instances of each 
journal issue or scanned TIFF images.  AT&amp;T produces a set of variable magnification TIFF image scans 
of each page, a set of bounding box coordinates for critical elements on the page, as well as the output of an 
OCR for each page in the form of horizontal and vertical positioning information for the box that bounds 
the element.  The browser is a  MOTIF<TM> graphical user interface client which communicates with a server 
using the Internet TCP/IP network protocol suite.  The server manages the data store of TIFF images and 
provides an interface to the Slimmer<TM> full-text database.</font>
<p>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">1.2.	WWW Red Sage Server</font> </h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	Since the influx of content is regular and constant, one priority in the development of the World 
Wide Web (WWW) Red Sage server was to keep the maintenance of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) 
pages to a minimum, thus the reliance on the HTML-generating server-side Common Gateway Interface 
(CGI) <A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/overview.html">[McCool 94a]</a> Perl scripts to ensure the highest level of confidence in the results.  At each level in 
the stack, from the level of journals in the collection down through the journal-specific levels such as year, 
volume issue and article, the server-side CGI scripts examine the on-line available content and produce 
HTML  that reflects actual, not theoretical content thereby all but eliminating faulty links.</font>
<p>
    <font face="Arial Narrow">
	Another goal was to reproduce the functionality of the AT&amp;T product completely.  As far as 
browsing, we have provided the user with equivalent functionality for navigating journals, years, volumes, 
issues, pages, articles, stacks and figures.  The freeWAIS-based full-text search system performs comparably 
to the Red Sage Slimmer database, while the MeSH search capability performs favorably with the AT&amp;T 
search engine while providing enriched functionality to essential to our patron community of biomedical 
researchers.  We have delayed implementation of the alerting feature of the AT&amp;T product, but have 
succeeded in integrating the content into a WWW client for the University of California's MELVYL 
bibliographic system.</font>
<p>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">1.3.	WAIS Indexing</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	We employ the WAIS full-text indexer and search engine to provide term searching for the system.  
The error-prone OCR text provided by AT&amp;T is stripped of its positioning information and combined with 
a MEDLINE record if available.  Not all journals are indexed by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), 
so coverage is lacking in some cases.   Each HTML page generated at all levels contains a hypertext link to 
the search page.  We also build WAIS indexes from the combined MEDLINE record and OCR text on a per-
journal basis, and the user is allowed to specify a set of journals on which to search as well as perform a 
full-text search across the entire collection.  When the MEDLINE record is available, we extract the MeSH 
terms that are a vocabulary of authorized terms sanctioned by the NLM and build a WAIS index of just 
those terms, weighting terms deemed particularly important by the indexers.  In order for the user to enter 
the authorized term, we create a set of webs that allow access to the MeSH term for searching through an 
alphabetic approach or by exploiting (to a limited degree) the hierarchical nature of the Medical Subject 
Headings.  In each case, the final selection is used as input to the searching routines and the results of the 
MeSH WAIS search are returned as any other WAIS search result set.</font>
<p>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">1.4.	MELVYL/Red Sage Client</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	One goal of the Center for Knowledge Management is to create a seamless interface to the various 
Internet resources of interest to the biomedical academic research community.  To that end, we have sought 
to integrate existing resources so that the distinctions between this prototype project and well-tested and 
used resources, such as the University of California System's Division of Library Automation's (DLA) 
MELVYL bibliographic indexing system are minimal.  We have developed a prototype system allows the 
user to enter a bibliographic search to the DLA's MEDLINE database through an HTML form, with the 
result set presented to the user as a set of HTML enriched MEDLINE records that include hypertext links to 
the TIFF page images of any results from the search that have content  in the Red Sage collection.</font>
<p>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">1.5.	Further Research</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	As any new technology is first deployed, at least as many questions are posed as are answered by 
the research and implementation.  In this case, the limitations of the current versions of HTTP (HyperText 
Transfer Protocol) and HTML, designed for near-interactive information interchange between researchers in 
rapidly evolving fields have begun to manifest themselves as that technology is applied as a production 
information presentation protocol.  In addition, in reexamining the RightPages system and the limitations 
of AT&amp;T's product (if any) present opportunities for further research and development.  The remainder of 
this paper shall focus on an in-depth discussion of the issues outlined throughout this overview.</font>
<p>
<h2><A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/www/public/CKM/ISSG/Projects/RedSage/Abstract.html">
<font face="Arial Narrow">
2.	Red Sage Project</font></a></h2>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
The University of California San Francisco Library and Center for Knowledge Management (CKM) 
is taking an important step in the creation of a knowledge management environment.  Through the Red 
Sage project, a collaborative effort founded by CKM, AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and Springer-Verlag, the 
collaborators are exploring the electronic distribution of journals directly to individual physicians and 
faculty computer desktops.[Lucier 92] With RightPages software developed by AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, 
researchers, clinicians, and students will be able to search, read and print the full-page text, including 
graphics and photographs, from an initial collection of journals published by Springer-Verlag, John Wiley 
&amp; Sons, the Massachusetts Medical Society and a number of other prominent publishers.</font>
<p>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">2.1.	Participants</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
With this project the participating organizations will investigate and begin to understand the 
technical, legal, economic, business, intellectual property rights and human factors issues surrounding the 
creation, distribution and use of scientific and medical information in a networked environment. As the first 
in a series of CKM originated projects, Red Sage will begin to examine the issues that are critical to the 
creation of the digital library of the future.  Initially the project will run on a local area network with a 
central document database server and multiple user stations.
Each member of the Red Sage project is contributing resources at its own expense.  Springer-Verlag 
and the other publishers are providing electronic content. AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratory is providing content 
preparation, quality control, and the server software and the initial client application. CKM is providing the 
test population, delivery infrastructure, evaluation and subsequent client development.</font>
<P>
<h4><font face="Arial Narrow">2.1.1.	Publishers</font></h4>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
Each publisher is initially providing monochrome page scans at 300 DPI, separate gray-scale figures 
(e.g. photographs, diagrams and tables) and structured1 header information (e.g. author, title, etc...).  
Additional content formats will be generated by the publishers in the second phase, including PostScript<TM>, 
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML - ISO 8879) tagged header, reference and body text, and 
potentially original  data sets and other research results.</font>
<P>
<h4><font face="Arial Narrow">2.1.2.	AT&amp;T Bell Laboratory</font></h4>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
The Bell Laboratory of AT&amp;T has developed, and will continue to refine, the RightPages server and 
client software.  The client software is a graphical user-interface (GUI) application for UNIX, Macintosh and 
PC computers under MOTIF, the Macintosh Finder and Microsoft Windows GUI environments.  AT&amp;T is 
also providing instrumentation and performance monitoring tools for the RightPages server, as well as 
determining the content delivery form(s) that publishers will be providing throughout the project, especially 
as publishers are able to provide SGML text for article body and reference sections.</font>
<P>
<h4><font face="Arial Narrow">2.1.3.	The University of California San Francisco</font></h4>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
The Library &amp; Center for Knowledge Management (CKM) manages the central server repository and 
its content, supports the local user community and determines infrastructure (e.g. server, network, staffing, 
etc...) requirements and scalability.  CKM is providing multiple system access terminals throughout the 
campus centers as well as within the Library.  In addition, software engineers are developing next-generation 
client interfaces and investigating links between the Red Sage content and other data sources (e.g. 
bibliographic, informal communication, scientific databases, etc...).  Members of the CKM staff will also 
evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of the project.  These evaluations consist of pre- and post-
deployment interviews with a targeted user community, analysis of usage data generated by client-server 
interactions (including hard copy requests), and continuous monitoring of the system's performance.</font>
<P>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">2.2.	 Technical Overview</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
The Red Sage Project has been assembled from a variety of sources.  The founding partners, CKM, 
AT&amp;T and Springer-Verlag envisioned the electronic distribution of published literature via computers and 
networking.  The RightPages software from AT&amp;T, developed at the Bell Laboratory [Story 92], provided 
the initial technology: a client/server model with a central server repository.  In 1992, the three partners 
agreed to proceed forward; AT&amp;T providing the software, Springer-Verlag the content, and CKM providing 
the test-bed.  In this section the technical subsystems are examined and explained; they are:  system 
requirements and implementation; content preparation, delivery and management; and client/server 
architecture.</font>
<P>
<h4><font face="Arial Narrow">2.2.1.	 System Requirements and Implementation</font></h4>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
The Red Sage Project incorporates a client/server architecture with three main aspects to the system 
infrastructure: server, network and client.  The server provides the data store for the journal content, 
computational support for the server processes that build, maintain and search content on behalf of client 
requests, and host processing for a number of directly supported access terminals.  The network connects the 
client to the server via the de facto Internet standard TCP/IP protocol, either on a local-area or wide-area 
topology.  The client application uncompresses images from the server, displays content with  a graphical 
user interface and supports printing to local printers.[Story 92]</font>
<P>
<h5><font face="Arial Narrow">2.2.1.1. Networking</font></h5>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
The RightPages client and server communicate via the Internet de facto standard TCP/IP protocol.  
This protocol is supported across both the local-area and wide-area networks that connect the distributed 
facilities of the University of California San Francisco and its affiliates.  The RightPages server system is 
located in the Library on the main Parnassus Heights campus; several access terminals are available in the 
Library and utilize the installed 10BASE-T Ethernet network.  There are also access terminals, provided by 
the Library and Center for Knowledge Management, located at San Francisco General Hospital, Mt. Zion 
Hospital and at the Veteran's Administration Hospital.  Each of these other facilities is connected to the 
Parnaussus Heights network via 1.54 M-bit/sec (T1) link and supports Ethernet locally.</font>
<P>
<h2><font face="Arial Narrow">3.	WWW Red Sage Server Implementation</font></h2>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	The statelessness of the WWW HTTP presents some interesting problems for the server-side script 
developer.  Each element of state must be preserved within the URL which is passed to the CGI script 
through the appropriate CGI environment variable.  For the purposes of this accessing a page in a Red Sage 
journal article, the elements of state are:</font>

<UL>
<LI>	<font face="Arial Narrow">	Journal Title</font>
<LI>	<font face="Arial Narrow">	Year</font>
<LI>	<font face="Arial Narrow">	Volume</font>
<LI>	<font face="Arial Narrow">	Issue</font>
<LI>	<font face="Arial Narrow">	Page</font>
</UL>

<font face="Arial Narrow">

At each level, we are able to determine all appropriate information from that point in content space from the 
above elements.  In the case where we arrive at a page image through navigation by the HTML generated by 
the server-side scripts and final translation of a click on an <ISMAP> table of contents entry, this is trivial.  
The scheme also functions properly if the above elements are provided through a different means, such as an 
external bibliographic system.  In the case of searching, we use the five elements of state described above to 
parse the issue structure file provided by AT&amp;T to produce a pointer to the first page of an article.</font>
<P>
<h3><A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/WWW_2_94/toplevel"><font face="Arial Narrow">3.1.	Top Level Navigation</font></a></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	When the patron opens the URL that points to the top-level of the Red Sage collection, the CGI 
script examines all entries at the highest level of content.  A list of all journals in the collection is 
presented as an HTML page containing greyscale TIFF images if the latest issue for each title.  The server-
side software queries the data store for the current status of the contents at that level so faulty links are 
avoided.  We can get this information either by examining the file system directly or by issuing a query to 
the Red Sage RightPages server daemon.  The greyscale icons for the most current contents for each 
subsequent level are organized and presented in LIFO order.  Thus, the patron can descend down from the 
collection of journals, through years, volumes and issues, finally reaching the first page of the text after 
selecting an article entry in the table of contents.  At each level, the CGI-generated HTML page contains 
hypertext links to the parent page as well as to the appropriate child pages, the top-level page and a search 
page.</font>
<P>
<h3><A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/WWW_2_94/toc"><font face="Arial Narrow">3.2.	Table Of Contents</font></a></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	After navigating to an article in an issue, the user is presented with an HTML page containing a 
TIFF image of the table of contents page or pages.  At the present time, AT&amp;T adds value in the form of a 
file for each issue which contains position and bounding box coordinates for each item in the table of 
contents.  The <ISMAP> HTML tag is used to pass the coordinates of the user's mouse click on the Table 
of Contents to the server, which returns an HTML page with the appropriate first page image and 
navigation buttons for the selected article.  Along with each issue AT&amp;T provides data files which describe 
the position of each page relative to its article as well as pointers to any high-quality figure images 
associated with each article.[O'Gorman 92]</font>
<P>
<h3><A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/WWW_2_94/page"><font face="Arial Narrow">3.3.	Page Delivery</font></a></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	Once we reach the terminal level; that of content provision, the server-side Perl [Wall 90] scripts 
select the appropriate full-text TIFF page image for the selected resolution and builds an HTML page around 
it.  Note that the TIFF image format is not currently supported as an inline option for NCSA's Mosaic 
World Wide Web browser.  Cheong S. Ang, a software engineer at the CKM has incorporated the public 
domain TIFF library code into the browser so that the images are presented as inline images on the page. 
	At the head of each page are four sets of buttons; one set for page-wise navigation, one for article-
wise navigation, a third for stacks navigation and the fourth for miscellaneous options.  The footer of the 
page contains a link to any high-quality images, currently JPEG images of the figures associated with each 
article.  Since these pages are always generated on-the-fly, we are assured of the validity of each link.  If the 
software can't guarantee the validity of a particular link, whether for lack of content or failure to convert an 
external bibliographic reference to content (content anomaly) it is either grayed out of replaced with the 
next-best choice.  The first and last of each set are almost always active while context determines the state 
of next and previous.  The sets of buttons are described below.</font> 
<P>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">3.4.	Content Navigation Buttons</font></h3>
<P>
<h4><font face="Arial Narrow">3.4.1.	Page-Wise Navigation</font></h4>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	These buttons provide the ability to navigate within the article.  First and last page of the current 
article are always active, while next and previous page buttons are enabled if appropriate.  We query the 
positioning files provided by AT&amp;T in the data store to determine the position of this page at the article and 
issue level.  Since we pre-resolve all hypertext links checking for the existence of the actual TIFF contents 
the system always returns an valid pointer.  The hypertext link generated is thus guaranteed to be as valid as 
the data store is accessible.</font>
<P>
<h4><font face="Arial Narrow">3.4.2.	Article-Wise Navigation</font></h4>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	Similar to the page navigation functions, the article buttons allow navigation within the issue 
according to the page positioning data provided by AT&amp;T.  The article buttons function as their page-wise 
analogs.</font>  
<P>
<h4><font face="Arial Narrow">3.4.3.	Stacks Navigation</font></h4>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	At each level, we generate a set of stack pointers that allow navigation between levels without 
having to reload images in the skipped levels.   One drawback that the current HTTP/HTML client-server 
architecture presents is the inability to force-cache images that can require constant reloading.  With some 
sixty (60)  iconic images on the top level of the collection, the overhead of that many HTTP connections 
rapidly approaches that of the data transfer itself.  If we have learned anything about the limitations of 
HTML and HTTP as implemented now from this project, it is the need for both always/never caching hints 
to the browsers to and the incorporation of an MGET facility in HTTP.  At present,  we provide direct 
access to the top level and the volume level from each page image.</font>
<P>
<h4><font face="Arial Narrow">3.4.4.	Miscellaneous Navigation</font></h4>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	At the level of content delivery, Navigational options include several links to additional features of 
the system.  The user can select a magnification level for page images using a zoom toggle button.  This 
choice stays in effect for the duration of the session.  A link to the script that generates the WAIS search 
page is included in this section, as is a link back to the table of contents for the current issue.  A link is 
included to an HTML enriched presentation of the MEDLINE record for the article, if available.  In the case 
that the MEDLINE record is available, the system attempts to build a web of enriched MEDLINE abstract 
pages for each article in the issue which can serve as an annotated table of contents.</font>
<P>
<h3><A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/WWW_2_94/figures"><font face="Arial Narrow">3.5.	Figures</font></a></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	AT&amp;T currently provides high-quality JPEG scans of any figures that might accompany an article.  
The assignment of images to articles is controlled by the group description files associated with each issue.  
If the CGI scripts detect any figures for an article, links are placed at the bottom of the page  and the 
browser calls the appropriate visualization program to present the image to the user.</font>
<P>
<h3><A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/WWW_2_94/searchpage"><font face="Arial Narrow">3.6.	Searching</font></a></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	In order to reproduce the functionality of the AT&amp;T system, we chose the WAIS index and search 
engine to build an inverted index of the full-text and MEDLINE information.  When a user clicks on that 
hypertext link, a CGI script builds a search page dynamically that:</font>

<UL>
<LI>	<font face="Arial Narrow">	Allows the user to enter a free-text search term.</font>
<LI>	<font face="Arial Narrow">	Shows the user all journals which have been WAIS indexed individually.</font>
<LI>	<font face="Arial Narrow">	Presents a link to the two interfaces to the Medical Subject Headings search facility.</font>
</UL>

<font face="Arial Narrow">

After the search is complete, an HTML page is generated that allows the user to view the results as a set of 
formatted MEDLINE records that include bibliographic information, the full abstract, if available and the 
ability to search the MeSH index using the authorized MeSH term.  From either the raw search results or 
the enriched MEDLINE record, the user can jump directly to the full-page TIFF image by a hypertext link.</font>
<P>
<h2><font face="Arial Narrow">4.	WAIS indexing</font></h2>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	In addition to the OCR of the scanned text image supplied by AT&amp;T , we query the MELVYL 
MEDLINE index of biomedical journals for extended bibliographic data on each article.  In order to preserve 
the integrity of the AT&amp;T supplied content, we create a mirror tree of MEDLINE records on traditional 
magnetic disk that corresponds to the TIFF data on MO storage.  From this parallel tree, we generate the 
WAIS indices used in the searching features of the system.<A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/WWW_2_94/wais-concepts">[Kahle 89]</a>
</font>
<P>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">4.1.	Full Text</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	AT&amp;T provides an OCR of the scanned text page as a set of coordinates describing the position 
and dimensions a bounding box and the corresponding text.  This information is not useful for 
reconstructing the logical content for such applications as presentation through an ASCII WWW client, but 
can be used for a full-text search.  We remove the coordinate information from the file, and combine it with 
the NLM MEDLINE index record.  A WAIS index is then built of all article's MEDLINE record and 
scanned text file, with the WAIS Headline field in the Doc ID overloaded to present a URL as the headline 
when searched.</font>
<P>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">4.2.	Fielded Search</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	We have also deployed the WAIS indexing software to construct a brute-force relational database of 
sorts.  The MEDLINE record for each article is compiled by the NLM and provides a set of authorized terms 
from the hierarchical Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) system.  We create a WAIS index for the whole 
collection as well as for each journal of the MeSH terms in the constituent MEDLINE records.  Since the 
MeSH is an controlled vocabulary, we create a web of HTML that allows the used to select a search term 
either alphabetically or through the hierarchical sub-headings.  This is one of the pre-cooked aspects of the 
system in that we must perform a download of MEDLINE records from MELVYL and then process the 
entire result set.  Downloading the records from MELVYL takes several hours, while the Perl script that 
generates the MeSH web takes approximately 20 minutes. The searches are quite speedy, less than 1 second, 
due to the small size of the MeSH terms.</font>
<P>
<h2><A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/WWW_2_94/www_melvyl"><font face="Arial Narrow">5.	WWW MELVYL/Red Sage Client</font></a></h2>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	One of the appealing features of the World Wide Web is the ability to effectively obscure the 
specific details of the precise network tasks performed upon the activation of a hypertext link.  For the 
patron of the biomedical research library the details of the network mechanics involved in linking any 
number of related information stores for the maximum value added are irrelevant.  Towards that seamless 
knowledge management environment, we have developed an HTML interface to the DLA's MELVYL index 
of the NLM's MEDLINE annotated index of biomedical journal articles.
	Using a forms-based search page, a patron enters a search that starts a telnet(1) session to the 
MELVYL server.  A connection is made to the MEDLINE database, and a search is issued.  Upon 
successful completion of the search, the server processes the raw MEDLINE record, presenting the author, 
title, journal name, volume and issue as well as the abstract.  If the server can determine that the article 
returned by the search is resident in the Red Sage data store, it will also include a hypertext link that 
interfaces to the page-level content delivery CGI script.  In this manner, the we have effectively linked the 
two distinct yet overlapping bibliographic systems.</font>
<P>
<h2><font face="Arial Narrow">6.	Modified HTTP Server</font></h2>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	We have been using the National Center for Supercomputing Applications httpd Hypertext server 
for delivering this content over the World Wide Web.<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Overview.html">[McCool 94]</a> A fine piece of software, we found it 
necessary to perform a few minor enhancements in order to serve the particular content as provided by 
AT&amp;T.  As a convention, most all World Wide Web clients and servers overload the filename with an 
extension in order to determine the type and the proper presentation method.  This legacy of the archaic MS-
DOS operating system was wholly inappropriate to huge data stores developed under environments far from 
the desktop personal computer.  The Red Sage TIFF images do contain the letters 'tiff' in the filename, but 
they are not at the end of the filename after a period.  
	In order to avoid either renaming gigabytes of TIFF to satisfy the filename overload convention to 
get the MIME content-type: set correctly or establishing a set of symbolic links with overloaded names to 
the original content, we chose to modify the server.  There exists a standard UNIX utility, file(1) which 
checks the magic(5) number, a unique bit sequence that identifies the type of a file, and sets the MIME 
content-type: field accordingly.  We integrated this code into the NCSA httpd server so that it bases the 
value of the content-type: field on the actual contents of the data file instead of an uncertain file extension.</font>
<P>
<h2><font face="Arial Narrow">7.	Further Research</font></h2>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	This project has been a prototype development effort, and in conducting the research required to 
produce this prototype, the opportunity for further enhancements have surfaced.  Since we are working from 
a commercial product supplied by AT&amp;T,. the needs of the academic research library diverge from the goals 
held by the developers of the original system.  Working towards a knowledge management environment, the 
mission here at the CKM is to integrate various networked information resources into a seamless, coherent 
user interface.  The ease of use of the World Wide Web system forces the complexities behind the scenes so 
that the  details of the network magic are hidden from the user.  Since integrating a large MOTIF 
RightPages client into Mosaic or any other WWW browser is impractical, we need to build upon the work 
done by the CERN, NCSA and others to build systems capable of delivering content to patrons with a 
minimum of effort and potential confusion.  A discussion of a few  of the more interesting points that the 
aforementioned development effort  produced follow.</font>
<P>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">7.1.	Alerting</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	The AT&amp;T system provides for an alerting system based on user-established profiles.  We would 
duplicate the functionality of the Red Sage system by implementing a cron(1) job that would collect the  
log files for newly loaded content and generate a hit list for each users' profile entries. based on a newly 
added content WAIS index created for this purpose.  Moving further on this model, we would like to design 
a more generalized alerting system that would query MELVYL MEDLINE for newly added content, provide 
an alert list, either through electronic mail or  a HTML page  with  links to the page images of any 
overlaps in the MEDLINE result set that were also resident in the Red Sage content.</font>
<P>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">7.2.	Automatic Bibliographic Updates</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	At the current time, we perform a bulk download of MEDLINE records from the DLA MELVYL 
system with no regularity.  We would like to establish a system where the aforementioned content load log 
files triggered a telnet(1) session that connects to MELVYL and downloads the MEDLINE record.  In 
addition, this would tie into the alerting subsystem as described above.  We are considering employing the 
auto update feature of MELVYL to initiate electronic mail messages triggered by the arrival of new content 
into the MEDLINE index as the method of obtaining the enriched bibliographic data.</font>
<P>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">7.3.	Delivery of Print Products</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	The quality of the scanned TIFF images provided by AT&amp;T varies greatly, although the image 
cleanup algorithms help substantially.  In any event, the logistics involved with transporting the higher 
resolution images across the network, even for local transfers, has the potential to create a bottleneck.  One 
solution that we have been examining is to designate an attribute associated with a URL, perhaps in 
accordance with the evolving URI standards or the DIENST 
<A HREF="http://cs-tr.cs.cornell.edu/Info/dienst_protocol.html">[Davis 94]</a> bibliographic content retrieval 
protocol, that would allow an HTTP query to request a printable instance of the object referred to by the 
URL.  Providing compressed PostScript data over the network would both lessen the bandwidth 
consumption as well as provide much higher quality printed output.</font>
<P>
<h3><font face="Arial Narrow">7.4.	Full MeSH</font></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	The authorized, hierarchical Medical Subject Headings provided by the NLM is a standardized 
vocabulary for conducting uniform biomedical bibliographic searches on the MEDLINE index.  We are 
currently in negotiation with the DLA procure a machine readable copy of this database so that we can 
integrate it into our searching and alerting systems.  Such a controlled vocabulary would provide 
consistency between the Red Sage content and the MELVYL MEDLINE system.</font>
<P>
<h3><A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/public/CKM/ISSG/Projects/GroupLink/Abstract.html"><font face="Arial Narrow">7.5.	LINK Tags</font></a></h3>
<font face="Arial Narrow">
	The specifications for HTML+ include the facility to impose an order on a set of HTML pages 
using the &lt;LINK&gt; and &lt;GROUP&gt; tags.  At the CKM, we are implementing this functionality, as it lends 
itself especially well to this application.  We intend to create relationships between pages in an article that 
fit into the defined roles of NEXT and PREVIOUS, as well as to the article's meta-information, such as 
CONTENTS and PARENT.  This functionality is being implemented directly into the Mosaic browser, so 
that the CGI scripts need only specify &lt;LINK&gt; tags instead of using hypertext links.  We hope to use this 
as a method of printing whole articles, as the meta-information for each page relative to the article will be 
available to the server using the PARTOF value for the ROLE attribute of the tag.</font>
