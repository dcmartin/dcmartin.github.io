Introduction
</h2>

When the first digital computer network was developed approximately twenty
years ago, its inventors had no idea that their creation would launch an
information revolution with profound effect on everyday life.  The development
of the Internet in the last ten years has made the wide distribution of
information technically and economically feasible.  However, until very
recently, there had been no means to provide ubiquitous and immediate access
to complex multimedia data (e.g. text, image, audio, video, etc...) from the
numerous emerging repositories.  The development of the national information
infrastructure (NII), in conjunction with both public domain (e.g. the
World-Wide-Web) and commercial (e.g. RightPages) software has enabled not only
effective access to such data for every user, but has also provided the
foundation of a means for more efficient and timely information exchange among
scientists and researchers.  It is our firm belief that these emerging
technologies hold the keys to the digital library, the library without
walls.
<p>

As one of the nations leading medical libraries and a pioneer in digital
information dissemination, the Library and Center for Knowledge Management
(CKM) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), has both
collaborated with industry partners and developed prototype systems, to begin
the realization of a knowledge management environment (KME) an environment
that exploits the power of distributed hypermedia documents and distributed
computational processing, integrating access to the entire universe of digital
information.  Two specific research efforts are underway: the Red Sage Project
and GALEN II prototyping.
<h2>

The Red Sage Project
</h2>

The published journal literature is an important method of conveying
information, especially in the medical profession.  However, the volume of
information that is being produced exceeds the ability of an individual to
separate the wheat from the chaff.  Through the Red Sage Project, a
collaborative effort founded by the UCSF Library and Center for Knowledge
Management (CKM), AT&ampT Bell Laboratories and Springer-Verlag, we are
exploring the electronic distribution of journals directly to individual
physician and faculty computer desktops utilizing automated alerting based on
user-interest profiles.  This experimental digital library provides
high-resolution bit-mapped page images, gray-scale figures, article header
information and the full-text of each article.
<p>

In 1992, the three partners agreed to proceed forward with an electronic
journal project at the Red Sage restaurant in Washington, D.C. (hence the
project name); AT&ampT providing the software, Springer-Verlag the content,
and CKM providing the test-bed.  The primary goal of the Red Sage Project is
to explore the technical, legal, economic, business, and social issues
surrounding the delivery of scientific, technical, and medical information in
a network environment.  To achieve this goal, a
<i>
critical mass
</i>
of content is required to make the system as appealing as possible to the
target user community: the faculty, staff and students of UCSF and its
affiliated institutions.  The content database has been expanded to include
additional publishers including John Wiley and Sons, the Massachusettes
Medical Society, and the American Medical Association, but is limited to three
categories: radiology, molecular biology, and general, high-impact (including
New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, and Lancet).  These journals provide
content of interest to the researcher, clinician and general reader.  The
database consists of over sixty titles, from more than twenty publishers and
will generally be available one to eight weeks prior to the receipt of printed
equivalents critical when key information may drastically influence
experimental and clinical programs.

The Red Sage Project has been assembled from a variety of sources.  The
RightPages software from AT&amp;T, developed at the Bell Laboratory, provided
the initial technology: a client/server model with a central server
repository.  The client software is a graphical user-interface (GUI)
application for UNIX, Macintosh and DOS computers under Motif(TM), the
Macintosh Finder and Microsoft Windows GUI environments.  The RightPages
server provides access to journal page images at the request of the client and
manages content receipt, maintains user-profiles to determine applicable
content and alerts users via electronic mail.  Journal content is accessed via
a proprietary connection-based protocol that provides mechanisms to
authenticate users, navigate the content hierarchy, query the text database,
and select pages for viewing and printing.
<p>

A central super-minicomputer provides the data store for the journal content,
computational support for the server processes that build, maintain and search
content on behalf of client requests, and host processing for a number of
directly supported access terminals. The current configuration is a four
processor UNIX computer with forty-eight (48) G-bytes of magnetic disk and a
340x1.3G-byte magneto-optical (MO) jukebox.  A hierarchical file system (HFS)
maintains the most recently used content on the fastest media.
<p>

The main features of the system provide the user with a traditional library
metaphor.  Scanned cover icons guide the user from titles to volumes to issues
and finally to articles.  Articles are selected from the table of contents
page via geographically defined active regions around each article listing.
User page through each article, scrolling vertically and horizontally as
necessary to view the entire page.  Pages are available in 72, 100 and 300
dot-per-inch versions, allowing users to determine their reading comfort
level, albeit with some increase in network transmission time.  Users may also
search for specific articles, specifying title and date restrictions in
addition to general Boolean full-text queries.  This same searching
functionality may be used for alerting as well; allowing the system to
identify articles of interest from newly arrived content.  Finally, users may
optionally specify a list of subscribed titles requesting notification of new
issues.  Users are alerted to new content, both subscriptions and alerts, via
electronic mail.
<p>

The Library and Center for Knowledge Management is evaluating the RightPages
system and the user communities reaction.  Statistics are being accumulated on
usage and use patterns: e.g.  content alerts, search results, articles
requested, subscription lists, pages viewed and pages printed.  In addition,
software engineers within the Center for Knowledge Management are developing
prototype client applications for both the Red Sage content and the burgeoning
data available on the Internet.
<h2>

The GALEN II Prototypes
</h2>

The General Access Library Electronic Network (GALEN) is the exiting on-line
information system deployed at the UCSF Library and Center for Knowledge
Management.  This kiosk-style front-end provides access to a wide variety of
electronic resources, including the Librarys on-line public access catalog
(OPAC) and the University of Californias Division of Library Automation (DLA)
MELVYL system.  This system has served the campus community for approximately
2 years and during that time the information resources available outside the
Librarys walls has increased in breadth, depth and complexity.  To provide
users access to these new and exciting inter-network services requires the
development of a new GALEN system; one providing access to all the services
that make up the Internet horde, (i.e. FTP, WAIS, WWW, Gopher, Archie,
Veronica, etc...), as well as growth for the information services of tomorrow.

<p>

The Library and Center have worked in concert to develop alternatives to
existing tools and design innovative new tools for network information
discovery and retrieval.  The Center has utilized wide-area information
servers (WAIS), the World-Wide-Web (WWW), and other freely available software
to develop several interfaces, including an alternative to the RightPages
client used in the Red Sage Project.  These prototype systems are being
developed as demonstrations of the capabilities available to the campus
faculty, staff and students and will be available during the planning phase of
the GALEN II Project, involving representatives from through-out the campus.
<p>

The prototypes under active development at this time include an alternative
RightPages client, a distributed visualization server (VIS), a Brookhaven
Protein Data Bank (PDB) database with integrated three-dimensional imaging,
and graphical interface to OPACs.  The prototype systems make use of WAIS to
search full-text, POSTGRES to maintain bibliographic information, and the
World-Wide-Web and Mosaic to provide the integration and user-interface.  The
systems are searchable by title, author, abstract and medical subject headings
(MeSH standard medical terminology defined by National Library of Medicine
(NLM).
<p>

<p>

The Center is also exploring the technical feasibility of using Mosaic and WWW
to integrate access between the published journal literature from the Red Sage
Project with the developing monolithic datasets of biomedically-relevant
structure information.  Such datasets generally share the common
characteristic of requiring sophisticated visualizations tools for browsing,
searching and analysis.  The Visible Human Project, the Visible Embryo
Project, the Brain Mapping Project, the Human Genome Project and other massive
research efforts are producing increasingly monolithic databases that defy
routine data exploration and interpretation.
<p>

The task of integrating access to such massive information and computational
resources is nontrivial.  One embryo, of the more than 650 serially sectioned
specimens in the Visible Embryo Project, yields as much as a terabyte of
anatomical volume data (n.b. 20mm specimen, sectioned at 5 microns and
digitized at 8000x8000 pixels/section and 36 RGB bits/pixel yields 1.073
T-bytes).  Clearly no single workstation or supercomputer can manipulate,
process and analyze such a dataset as a single unit, much less perform
computational operations on a database of embryos.  The Center has developed
tools that allow integrated, ubiquitous access (through NCSAs Mosaic) to
network visualization servers that can distribute the computational load
across a loosely-coupled network of both general purpose and specialized
graphic workstations and supercomputers.  Therefore text, images, audio,
video, and real-time interactive visualizations may be embedded within
hyperdocuments located anywhere on the network.  We are also exploring the use
of this technology for delivering interactive virtual reality (VR) across the
Internet.  The success of these efforts will allow wide-spread access to
highly accurate and complex simulations of human development, non-invasive
surgery, and other VR applications via inexpensive workstations and personal
computers. 
<h2>

Conclusion
</h2>

As our work demonstrates, the library of tomorrow will bear little resemblance
to the library of today.  Collections will no longer be limited to print and
other types of static information; most collections will include a combination
of raw scientific data, electronic journals and books, interactive
instructional textbooks, digitized video and audio, and other types of
hypermedia.  With the development of ubiquitous client applications, common
frameworks for accessing the information stored across the Internet, and the
national information infrastructure, the essential elements of the library
without walls are already in place.  Imagine a researcher viewing electronic
journals from the UCSF Library, searching National Library of Medicine
catalog, visualizing a stereographic image of a six-week embryo via
supercomputers in Urbana, Illinois, and conversing with a colleague in the
suburbs of Los Angeles all while at home in San Jose, California.
